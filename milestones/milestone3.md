### Our Path (Describe the path you took to obtain the final result)
Introduction: Our group, Kingdom of Kaffa, enjoys a cup of fresh coffee daily. Not only we drink to boost up our energy to study endless amount of time, but we aslo like its taste and enjoy the culture of drinking cofee while programming. Thus, we decided to dedicate website and to learn about what we like - coffee. 

Initial dea: Our initial idea was to create an educational visualization showcasing the journey from coffee bean to a latte macchiato. However, upon discovering similar concepts online, we shifted our focus to coffee around us. This led us to our first question: Where can we find freshly roasted coffee beans nearby?

During our research, we discovered numerous European roasteries that offer a wide variety of high-quality coffee products. With so many options available, we asked ourselves: How can one select the perfect coffee product from a local roastery?

Final idea: As a result, our final goal for the visualization became helping users find their ideal coffee products from the affordable and pleasant roastery. To complete our visualization story, we also decided to illustrate the global impact of coffee on the world and the connection between different flavored coffees and various food flavors.

Data collection: However, searching the necessary dataset for our specific idea about European coffee brands proved challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we utilized web scraping techniques to extract data from Kofio.co, an online collection of European roasteries and their coffee products. Additionally, we sought ideas and information from Kaggle datasets and relevant websites.

Visulations: Once we gathered the data, we conducted a detailed analysis to understand the information we aimed to present. We finalized four visualizations for our website, drawing inspiration from the works of our peers and incorporating insights gained from lectures. We determined the draft layout for our website and divided the visualizations among team members to ensure a cohesive outcome.

Implementation: Following the recommendations provided in the course, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js library to code our animated plots. Our  focus was initially on coding the basic functionality of our figures, which we then integrated into a unified whole. After creating the initial draft of our website, firstly we evaluated whether the user story aligned with the journalistic model. Secondly, we refined the visual aspects of our website, such as core layout and navigation, style, colors, and background.

Correction and finalizing: After we were satisfied with our website, we sought feedback from friends and family to improve it even more. Our target were individuals of different ages and varying levels of coffee experience. With their input on visuals, storytelling, and website functionality, we iterated and arrived at the final version of our website.

### Challenges

- Choosing visualisation - we ahve been tweaking them till the latest moment, cause they dont look good enough
- Using d3.js - new library for us thus it took time to adapt (Yikai's bug on circles)
- Deciding on the web style
- other ideas?
### Sketches
We can describe each figure:
- figure purpose
- initial sketch
- final result
- difference between the sketch and results

### Peer assessment

- we worked all together on ideas/story/background/data collection. Helped each otehr with bugs/cleaning/etc. The only separation was the actual implementtion of figures.

- Yikai - figure 3
