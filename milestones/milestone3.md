### Our Path (Describe the path you took to obtain the final result)
Initial dea: Our initial idea was to create an educational visualization showcasing the journey from coffee bean to a latte macchiato. However, upon discovering similar concepts online, we shifted our focus to coffee around us. This led us to our first question: Where can we find freshly roasted coffee beans nearby?

During our research, we discovered numerous European roasteries that offer a wide variety of high-quality coffee products. With so many options available, we asked ourselves: How can one select the perfect coffee product from a local roastery?

Final idea: As a result, our main goal for the visualization became helping users find their ideal coffee products from the affordable and pleasant roastery. To complete our visualization story, we also decided to illustrate the global impact of coffee on the world and the connection between different flavored coffees and various food flavors.

Data collection: However, gathering the necessary data for our specific idea about European coffee brands proved challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we utilized web scraping techniques to extract data from Kofio.co, an online collection of European roasteries and their coffee products. Additionally, we sought ideas and information from Kaggle datasets and relevant websites.

Visulations: Once we gathered the data, we conducted a detailed analysis to understand the information we aimed to present. We finalized four visualizations for our website, drawing inspiration from the works of our peers and incorporating insights gained from lectures. We determined the draft layout for our website and divided the visualizations among team members to ensure a cohesive outcome.

Implementation: Following the recommendations provided in the course, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js library to code our animated plots. Our  focus was initially on coding the basic functionality of our figures, which we then integrated into a unified whole. After creating the initial draft of our website, firstly we evaluated whether the user story aligned with the journalistic model. Secondly, we refined the visual aspects of our website, such as core layout and navigation, style, colors, and background.

Correction and finalizing: After we were satisfied with our website, we sought feedback from friends and family to improve it even more. Our target were individuals of different ages and varying levels of coffee experience. With their input on visuals, storytelling, and website functionality, we iterated and arrived at the final version of our website.
