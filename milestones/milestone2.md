## Milestone 2

### Project Overview

In this section, we'll go into detail about the **design and purpose** of our 4 visualizations. Sketches of each visualization will be displayed to give a general idea of our final result.

#### Viz 1

#### Viz 2

#### Viz 3

#### Viz 4

### Tools Requirement

**Page Structure**: For structuring our project pages, we use _[**fullpage.js**](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/),_ which provides smooth and pretty switches among pages.

**Theme Colors:** We mainly resort to **_Lecture 6_** for choosing a group of theme colors for our website.

**Data Preparation**: To prepare the data to visualize in a proper format, we use **_Pandas_** library to do the data cleaning part, which includes dealing with missing fields, deserting unwanted fields, and storing in CSV files. After that, **_d3.js_** is used to load the data from CSV files to the Javascript dictionary. **_Lecture 4_** is needed for the data loading part.

**Data Visualization**: We mainly use **_d3.js_** for data visualization, detailed operations include data point demonstration and interation design. **_Lecture 4_** and **_Lecture 5_** are mainly required for **_d3.js_**-related knowledge.

**Story Telling**: To improve our storytelling for this project, we plan to polish our text information according to **_Lecture 12_**.

### Project Break Down

In this section, we describe the core visualization we'd love to demonstrate and extra ideas which we believe can enhance the visualization first, and then the whole project is broken down into independent pieces to make it more manageable.

#### Core Visualization

#### Extra Ideas

#### Project Break Down
