## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic
Originating from the mysterious land of the Kingdom of Kaffa in Eutopia, coffee has evolved into much more than a tasty and healthy beverage. It has transcended into a cultural symbol, a social ritual, a source of comfort, and a muse for inspiration. Across the globe, coffee shops have transformed into meeting places for friends, colleagues, and neighbors, fostering a sense of community. Additionally, coffee production is a significant economic driver in numerous societies, offering income and employment opportunities to small-scale farmers and large-scale plantations. 

Recognizing coffee's prestige, our project Kingdom of Kaffa provides a comprehensive overview of coffee's impact, including its various origins, flavors, and brewing techniques. Our website also serves as a platform for users to find their ideal and real European coffee brand, facilitating their immersion into the coffee community. Our website caters to coffee enthusiasts and beginners, allowing everyone to find their perfect cup of coffee.

To meet the goals describe above, our website will roughly (might change sligthly overtime) contain the following visualizations:

**Figure 1:** This map displays the import and export levels of coffee on a country level over the years. Through this visualization, users can see how the demand for coffee has changed, the global distribution of coffee plantations, and the countries with the highest consumption rates.

**Figure 2:** This graph illustrates the prices and ratings of various European coffee brands. Users can easily compare the data and select the best brand according to their preferences.

**Figure 3:** This bubble-cluster visualization provides filtering options based on flavor, brewing method, and roast level. Users can input their preferences, and the visualization will output the coffee that best aligns with their taste.


<!-- > Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience. -->


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
